What is dymanic programming

1+1+1+1+1+1 = ?

1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = ?

so here add all numbers in the first question which gives 6
then place it in the second question

6+2 = 8

So DP is break down into a collection of similar problems
and store there solution

It is exactly like divide and conquer and the only difference
is that in both cases we break problems into smaller problem
but in case of DP we will store subproblems result
so if they come again and again we will reuse the solution

Optimal substructure
--Divide and conquer fb(n) = fb(n-1) + fb(n-2)

Overlapping subproblem (DP)
 -- Do divide and conquer and reuse the same for solving same subproblem

Optimal substructure + Overlapping problem = Dynamic programming

Fibonacci series
 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ..

 fibRes(n){
    if (n is less than 1)return error
    else if(n==1) return 0
    else if(n==2) return 1
    else fibRes(n-1) + fibRes(n-2)
 }


  in above we can reuse

Top down approach (Momoization)
 Problem is broken into smaller subproblems
 Then these subproblems are solved. And the solution to these subproblems are remembered

Bottom up approach (Tabulation)
Start from small and go toward big

top vs bottom
rumtime for top is slow and for bottom is fast
space use of extra space (in top) and no stack used in bottom
when to use --top for need a quik solution and need a effective solution
