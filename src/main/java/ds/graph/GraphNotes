#BFS
==============
Runtime / Space O(V+E)
In BFS it is level order traversal
Works same way for directed/undirected graph

#Creation
GraphNode
-----------------
Have String/Integer has vertex
Take it in the constructor(vertex name)
Have a boolean field (visited)

Main Class
-----------------
Create 2 dimensional array with size
Create List of vertex(run a for loop upto 10 and use graph constructor)
Add neighbors ..let say you need to add 1,2 (undirected edge) then
    a[1][2] = 1
    a[2][1] = 1 //for directed dont do this

Traversal
-----------------
Get list of vertices
For each vertex
    if vertex not visited
    visit(vertex)

Visit(vertex)
Create Queue
Add vertex to Queue
Mark visited //critical if not marked then this will come again
Get neighbors
For each neighbor
    If not visited
    Add to queue
    mark it as true

//if given a verted then start from there

BFS -- cannot be done in a disconnected graph
